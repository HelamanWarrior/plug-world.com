I was looking for T-shirts with cool graphics and designs.
Found a few good looking T-shirts, but I've decided that I should just make a few of my own.

I really liked the designs from Judah & the Lion's album covers. 
They released 3 singles in the same style: Spirit, Beautiful Anyway, and Help Me to Feel Again. 

So I ended up making a T-Shirt from one of them.

I think it turned out pretty well.
Definitely planning on making more T-shirts like this in the future.
