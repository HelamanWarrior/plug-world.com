Went for a hike up in Snowbasin. 
It was just me, Mia and my mom.

Somehow it turned into a 6 mile hike. 
Not exactly what we signed up for. 
But it wasn't too bad. 
Most of it was pretty flat there was a little bit of uphill, but overall pretty gradual.

Mia tried to count butterflies, after 12 we lost count.
On the way back we ran into a rattle snake, so that was pretty cool.
