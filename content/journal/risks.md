"It liberates you intellectually and physically to take big, bold risks. I can live a thousand lives; there's so many trajectories. And imagine the greatest possible trajectory, that reveals the most beautiful thing I could possibly create. What is that? I feel like that's a good exercise to think about, because it's also liberating to think that you can do anything." 

-Lex Fridman
