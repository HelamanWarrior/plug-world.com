Don't wait for tomorrow to be happy.
Often we think if only I had a new car, or a new phone, or got a new house, than I'll be happy.
Maybe you recieve a short burst of temporary happiness.
But in the end you will still find yourself unhappy.
Happiness is a choice.
You can find happiness in the most unlikely places.
You can be the richest person in the world and still be unhappy.
People with almost nothing may still be more rich with happiness than you.
Your circumstances have little impact on happiness.
Don't look to tomorrow to be happy... be happy today.
