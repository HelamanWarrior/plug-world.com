I just feel alone.

I know that's normal.

Everyone feels alone at points in their life.

But this time feels different.

I look back on my life.

And remember all the things I missed out on.

All because I prioritized the wrong things.

But that time is spent.

I need to look to the future.

Choose where to spend it now.
