A year ago I installed Graphene OS on my Pixel 3a.
It all kind of happened by accident.

Long story short my dad bought a Pixel 3a.
He originally was going to give it to a relative, but after giving the phone a look I decided that I wanted it. 
So instead, we gave them my Samsung Galaxy S8 and I kept the Google Pixel 3a.

Yeah basically I gave away my Samsung Galaxy S8 for a Pixel 3a.
Considering the specs alone the Galaxy S8 is far more superior than the Pixel 3a.
But after using the Pixel 3a, I realized how snappy, smooth, and non bloated the phone was.
My Samsung phone felt so much slower compared to this.
I don't know how I lived with all the Samsung junk that slowed down the phone.

What I learned from this is that software is equally as important as hardware.
Crappy bloated software can make great hardware run slower.

The other reason I opted for the Pixel 3a was the unlocked bootloader.
This was a game changer.
I didn't know too much about custom android roms at the time, but I knew I wanted to get into it.
