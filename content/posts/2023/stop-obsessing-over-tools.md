I'm writing this post mainly for myself as I have fallen victim to this problem.
But I hope this helps others as well.

I often see people in a constant search for the **best** note taking app.
Or the **best** Linux distro and desktop setup.
Or the **best** AI tool to *enhance productivity.*
Or the **best** game engine.
And so on, you guys get the point.

This search takes you nowhere.
Doing this doesn't make you productive.
You will never find the **best** or the most **perfect** setup.
Settling for *good enough* is most often the best thing you do.
Otherwise you'll find yourself productive in the search of being productive.

My advice, find something and stick to it.
Even if it's not perfect.
It doesn't need to be.
Just get the work done.
