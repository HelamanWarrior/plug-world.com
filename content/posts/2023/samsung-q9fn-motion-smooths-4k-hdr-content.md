Samsung Q9FN motion smooths 4k/HDR content despite being disabled in settings.

Solution: **While playing HDR content**, go into the TV settings, it should show that the picture is in HDR mode.
Click on the settings button, go to expert picture settings, and disable the motion smoothing settings.
The TV has separate settings for SDR and HDR content.
Disabling the settings for SDR content doesn't disable for HDR.
Wish I would've thought of this earlier.
Hope this helps!
