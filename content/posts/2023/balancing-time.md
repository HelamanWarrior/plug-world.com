It's the new year, and I'm already late on posting my new year's post.
With it being the new year, I pondered on what I could do to best improve myself.
After just reflecting on the past Christmas break, I realized that I need to balance my time better.

I believe everyone struggles with this with varying degrees.
The more concious we are of it, the better we can mitigate it.
