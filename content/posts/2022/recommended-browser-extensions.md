- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
	- An efficient blocker add-on, blocks ads and trackers.
	- Enable some of the annoyances filters to get rid of cookie popups.
- [Cookie Auto Delete](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/)
	- Automatically deletes cookies from websites, whitelist websites you use to keep their cookies.
- [Redirector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirector/)
    - Automatically redirects to user-defined urls on certain pages
    - I use this for **privacy frontends**
        - Reddit -> Libreddit
        - Twitter -> Nitter
- [Skip Redirect](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skip-redirect/)

All together with [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and custom profile from [ffprofilemaker](https://ffprofile.com/).

On Android I use the [Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium) with DNS adblocking.
