The campground is quite big and very open.
It's near [Monte Cristo Campground](https://goo.gl/maps/sskRANy1v7mK4N2r5), however you have to pay there, whereas this spot's free. 

The dirt road is uneven and the campground isn't very flat.
I wouldn't recommend sleeping in tents here unless you bring a cot.

There's some trails that lead into the dense forest of trees.
However it's very overgrown, watch out for the many ant hills.

Anyways, it's very pretty. Fun spot to hangout and camp.
Just plan on bringing some bugspray.
